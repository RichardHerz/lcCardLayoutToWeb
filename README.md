# lcCardLayoutToWeb
Design a card layout in LiveCode, then export the layout to HTML and CSS files. 

For initial commit, each LiveCode (LC) control is referenced in CSS by id only. LC controls in initial commit include groups, standard buttons, menu buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, locked fields, unlocked fields, and sliders (range inputs). 

No LiveCode script conversion.
